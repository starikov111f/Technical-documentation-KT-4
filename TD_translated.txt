TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION - "OCEAN PUZZLES"
1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
"Ocean Puzzles" is a 2D puzzle game set in an underwater world with item crafting mechanics. The player explores coral reefs, collects resources, and creates tools to solve environmental puzzles. The game loop revolves around exploring locations, gathering materials, and restoring marine ecosystems.

Development goals: intuitive puzzle interface, smooth underwater animations, modular crafting system.

2. GAME MECHANICS
2.1 Puzzle System
Puzzle types:

Assembling coral fragments

Connecting ocean currents

Placing marine creatures in food chains

Mechanics: dragging, rotating, connecting elements

Difficulty: progressive increase from 4 to 64 elements

2.2 Underwater World
Dynamic environment: currents, lighting changes, fish migration

Interactive zones: coral reefs, shipwrecks, underwater caves

Seasonal changes: affect resource availability and puzzle types

2.3 Item Crafting System
Resources: seaweed, shells, pearls, corals

Tools: nets, scalpels, growth enhancers

Structures: water purifiers, coral farms, fish shelters

3. LEVEL SYSTEM
3.1 Location Structure
Zones: Coastal → Reef → Deep Sea → Abyssal

Level sizes: 3×3 to 8×8 sectors

Procedural generation: resource and obstacle placement

3.2 Puzzle Design
Level = {
  "goal": "restore coral reef",
  "elements": ["coral_red", "coral_blue", "seaweed"],
  "constraints": "temperature", "acidity", "predators"
}
